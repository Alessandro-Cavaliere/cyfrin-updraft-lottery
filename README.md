## Introduction

The Cyfrin Updraft Lottery is a project that focuses on writing a Solidity smart contract for a lottery system. It is designed to provide practice in developing smart contracts using Solidity and the Sepolia Test Network of the Ethereum Blockchain. The project aims to enhance participants' understanding of smart contract development and lottery systems.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Ticket purchasing and management
- Random number generation for lottery draws
- Prize distribution and winner announcement

## Usage

To use the Cyfrin Updraft Lottery contract, you have two options:

1. Remix: You can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, to deploy and interact with the contract. Simply copy the contract code into Remix, compile it, and deploy it on the Sepolia Test Network. From there, you can use Remix's interface to interact with the contract and perform actions such as purchasing tickets and announcing winners.

2. Foundry Testing: Another option is to use Foundry, a testing framework for Solidity contracts. With Foundry, you can write test cases to simulate different scenarios and ensure the contract functions as expected. By running the tests, you can verify the functionality of the contract and identify any potential issues.
